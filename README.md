# PD_stats
A project designed with algorithms to compute PD Stats
#preprocessing
preprocess the tree to count teminals of each node, get postorder nodes, index all nodes on the tree, gets the binomial coifficients
#MinPD
contains the method/algorithm to compute the min pd for a tree. 
Input:- tree, k(no. of terminals to be selected), preproccessed values
Output:- Max PD
#avg
contains the method/algorithm to compute the average pd for a tree. 
Input:- tree, k(no. of terminals to be selected), preproccessed values
Output:- Avg PD
#MaxPD
contains the method/algorithm to compute the max pd for a tree. 
Input:- tree, k(no. of terminals to be selected), preproccessed values
Output:- Max PD
#sum_sq
contains the method/algorithm to compute the sum of squares of PD for a tree. 
Input:- tree, k(no. of terminals to be selected), preproccessed values
Output:- sum of squares of PD
#min_check
runs MinPD on a tree
#avg_check
runs avg on a tree
#max_check
runs MaxPD on a tree
#var check
runs sum_sq on a tree and returns the variance along with std. deviation
